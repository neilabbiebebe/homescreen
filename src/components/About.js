        I'm Chrisela Jel Gaudicos Godarido. I am very good at adapting to different people. Sometimes, I take on a confident-boosting, friendly, and humorous attitude. I find this to be very helpful with friends whoâ€™ve just had a bad day. Other times Iâ€™m quiet and welcoming.I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.I Believe that everything happens in a particular reason so every steping stones I've  step I should  let my feet define my failures . I can let my failures teach me as who I am as a person.
